# v2 build — orchestrator decisions log

Records architectural decisions the orchestrator made when a spec was ambiguous, plus validated-gap
notes for phases that weren't dry-run-validated in the plan.

## Phase 3 — DuckDB analytics

### D-3.a — server spawn cwd / repoRoot (T-3.2)
**Problem:** `/api/stats` must `Bun.spawn(["bun","run","v2:analytics", …], {cwd: repoRoot})`, but
`createApp` only receives `db`, `webDir`, `dbPath` — there is no `repoRoot` in `AppOptions`, and the
stats test drives the app via `app.request(...)` (no `serve.ts`), so it can't rely on process.cwd().
`serve.ts` derives `webDir = resolve(import.meta.dir, "../../web")`, i.e. repoRoot =
`resolve(import.meta.dir, "../../..")` from `packages/server/src/`.
**Decision:** add optional `repoRoot?: string` to `AppOptions`; `createApp` defaults it to
`resolve(import.meta.dir, "../../..")`. `serve.ts` may pass it explicitly (same value). The stats
handler spawns with `cwd: repoRoot`. This keeps the server DuckDB-free (it only spawns the CLI) and
makes the test deterministic.
**Spec fix:** PHASE3 T-3.2 / CONTRACTS §6 — note `AppOptions.repoRoot?: string` (default
`resolve(import.meta.dir,"../../..")`); stats spawns with `cwd: repoRoot`.

### D-3.b — analytics test fixtures built via spawned ingest CLI (T-3.1, T-3.2, T-3.4)
**Problem:** ground rule #3 — a process linking `bun:sqlite` must never also load DuckDB's sqlite
extension. The analytics duck.test.ts must open DuckDB; if it also imported `@clogdy/ingest`
(`openDb`/`runIngest`, which use `bun:sqlite`) in the same process, that's a double SQLite link.
**Decision:** all analytics/stats/e2e fixtures are built by **spawning** the ingest CLI in a separate
process: `Bun.spawnSync(["bun","run","v2:ingest","--backfill","--root",tmpTree,"--db",tmpDb],{cwd:repoRoot})`,
THEN open DuckDB in the test process. Never `import { openDb } from "@clogdy/ingest"` in a file that
also loads DuckDB. (The server stats.test.ts / e2e-stats.test.ts use the server's bun:sqlite + spawn
DuckDB as a child — compliant; they too build the fixture DB via the spawned ingest CLI.)
**Spec fix:** already in PHASE3 T-3.1 note; reaffirm for T-3.2/T-3.4 — fixture DB = spawned ingest CLI.

### D-3.c — latency self-join filter application
**Problem:** PHASE3 says "Apply filters to `u`" for the latency metric. The shared `buildWhere`
emits bare column names (`tool = ?`, `kind = ?`), but the self-join references `u.tool`, `r.kind`,
etc. A bare `WHERE kind = ?` would be ambiguous across the two aliases.
**Decision:** the latency query's WHERE applies the ported filter to the `u` (tool_use) side with an
alias prefix. Port `buildWhere` to accept an optional table alias (e.g. `buildWhere(f, "u")` →
`u.tool = ?`), and the join already pins `u.kind='tool_use' AND r.kind='tool_result'`, so the
filter's own `kind` (if any) is dropped for this metric (a kind filter is meaningless for a
use↔result pair). toolCounts/errorRate/projectRollup/timeBuckets query a single `live.event` and use
the unaliased buildWhere.
**Spec fix:** PHASE3 T-3.1 latency bullet — buildWhere takes an alias; drop any `kind` filter for the
latency metric (the join pins both kinds).

### D-3.d — timeBuckets must use DuckDB floor-division `//`, NOT `/` (T-3.1, verified-bug)
**Problem:** PHASE3 T-3.1 timeBuckets bullet specifies `(ts/3600000)*3600000` and the inline comment
claimed "DuckDB integer division floors for positive ints". **That is false.** DuckDB's `/` is TRUE
division → returns DOUBLE, so `* 3600000` round-trips back to ~ts and every row lands in its own
bucket (the metric returns one bucket per event instead of hour-floored buckets). Verified directly:
`SELECT 1700000001500 / 3600000 * 3600000` → `1700000001500` (no floor); `//` → `1699999200000`
(correct hour floor, returns BIGINT).
**Decision:** timeBuckets SQL uses `(CAST(ts AS BIGINT) // 3600000) * 3600000 AS bucket`. The T-3.1
agent found and fixed this independently; verified by the orchestrator.
**Spec fix:** PHASE3 T-3.1 timeBuckets bullet — replace `/` with `//` (DuckDB floor-division); delete
the "integer division floors" claim. Anyone re-deriving the bucket SQL in T-3.3/T-3.4 must use `//`.

### D-3.e — analytics/e2e test fixtures need a trailing newline (T-3.1/T-3.4, tailer behavior)
**Problem:** the ingest offset-tailer (`packages/ingest/src/tailer.ts`, `text.lastIndexOf("\n")`)
delivers only complete lines up to the last `\n`; a final line WITHOUT a trailing newline is buffered
as a remainder and never delivered during backfill. A fixture built with `lines.join("\n")` silently
drops its last line. Real transcripts are append-only JSONL where every line ends with `\n`, so this
only bites synthetic test fixtures.
**Decision:** all synthetic transcript fixtures for analytics/stats/e2e tests MUST end with a trailing
`\n` (`lines.join("\n") + "\n"`). Not a shippable code change — a fixture-authoring rule.
**Spec fix:** PHASE3 T-3.1/T-3.4 test notes — fixtures end with a trailing newline (tailer withholds
an unterminated final line).

### D-3.f — toolCounts tie order is non-deterministic; assert order-insensitively (T-3.2/T-3.4)
**Problem:** `toolCounts` is `ORDER BY count DESC` — equal-count tools come back in arbitrary order, so
comparing the server's spawn output to a direct CLI spawn with order-sensitive `toEqual([...])` FLAKES
(observed: pass/fail alternating across runs). Same risk for any metric with ties (projectRollup,
latency).
**Decision:** stats/e2e tests that compare against a fixture compare order-insensitively for tie-prone
metrics — map `data` to a `{key→value}` object (e.g. `{tool→count}`) and `toEqual` that, or sort both
sides by a stable key first. The orchestrator applied this to T-3.2's toolCounts assertion.
**Spec fix:** PHASE3 T-3.2/T-3.4 test notes — assert tie-prone metric arrays order-insensitively.

### D-3.g — the obsolete `/api/stats → 501 stub` test must flip to 400 (T-3.2)
**Problem:** Phase-1/2 left a regression test `app.test.ts: "/api/stats → 501 stub"` asserting 501.
T-3.2 replaces the stub, so the full `bun test` goes red on that stale assertion (the per-task test run
doesn't catch it). `/api/stats` with no/invalid `metric` now returns **400** (the handler validates the
metric first).
**Decision:** the orchestrator updated that test to expect 400 (no/invalid metric → bad-metric 400).
A T-3.2 subagent restricted to "edit app.ts + add stats.test.ts" won't touch app.test.ts, so the
orchestrator owns this cross-cutting fixup.
**Spec fix:** PHASE3 T-3.2 — note that the pre-existing `app.test.ts` 501-stub assertion must be
updated to 400 as part of the task (or call it out as an orchestrator fixup).

### D-3.h — web Analytics view: no spec gaps; verified in a real browser (T-3.3)
**Problem/Note:** PHASE3 T-3.3 left the exact DOM/tab arrangement to the agent. No ambiguity bit. The
agent chose: a `#tabs` bar (`#tab-events`/`#tab-analytics`), the existing events table wrapped in
`#events-view`, and a sibling `<section id="analytics">`; the facet sidebar + filter chips stay across
tabs; `refreshAnalytics()` fetches all five metrics in parallel via `getStats(name, state.filter)` and
`load()` calls it on every filter change. All charts are dependency-free (divs + SVG, textContent only —
no XSS).
**Verification (orchestrator, Playwright over a live server on a known 6-event fixture):** tab toggle
works (analytics shown / events-view hidden); toolCounts barList Bash 2 / Read 1; errorRate gauge
"1 / 3 (33.3%)"; latency table Read 10/10/1, Bash 1000/1000/1; projectRollup myproj 6/3/1; timeBuckets
one spark bar. Clicking a `tool=Bash` facet correctly re-filtered the analytics (toolCounts → Bash 2
only; projectRollup → 6→2 events; errorRate → "no data", total=0). Only console error is a benign
`/favicon.ico` 404 (no favicon shipped) — not in the analytics path.
**Spec fix:** none needed; T-3.3 spec was sufficient. (Optional: ship a favicon to silence the 404.)

### D-3.i — e2e-stats latency expectation uses SINGLE pairs (crisp p50) (T-3.4)
**Problem:** PHASE3 T-3.4 floated a two-pair Bash case (gaps 1000+3000 → interpolated p50=2000), which
risks reconciling DuckDB's quantile_cont interpolation. The agent (correctly) chose the SINGLE-pair
form per metric: one Bash pair (gap 1000 → p50=p95=1000, n=1) and one Read pair (gap 10), plus a
second unmatched Bash tool_use and an orphan tool_result — so toolCounts has DISTINCT counts (Bash 2,
Read 1; no tie), errorRate is 3 results / 1 error = 1/3, projectRollup is 6/3/1, timeBuckets is one
bucket of 6. A filtered case (`project=other` → empty) proves the filter param flows
server→CLI→DuckDB. Ran 3× non-flaky.
**Spec fix:** PHASE3 T-3.4 — prefer single tool_use↔tool_result pairs for exact p50 (avoid two-point
quantile interpolation); use distinct tool counts so toolCounts ordering is deterministic.

## Phase 4 — Polish

### D-4.a — `resultLines` returns the structured array unconditionally (no v1 single-line collapse) (T-4.1)
**Problem:** v1's `resultColumn` had two HTML-render special cases — `total === 0` returned `{text:""}`
and a lone uncolored line returned plain text (no `<table>`). The T-4.1 port returns STRUCTURED data
(`Array<{text,color?}>`), so those collapses are presentation concerns that belong to the web caller,
not the data helper.
**Decision:** `resultLines({})` → `[]`; a single plain line → `[{text}]` (one entry, no `color` key).
The web's `resultCell` renders 0 lines as an empty `<td>` and 1+ lines as `.rline` divs — equivalent
output, cleaner contract. Recorded by the T-4.1 subagent; orchestrator confirms it's correct.

### D-4.b — web needs URL-param → filter parsing on init (added under T-4.2 to serve T-4.3) (T-4.2/T-4.3)
**Problem:** T-4.3's TUI handoff deep-links the v2 UI with `?project=…`/`?session=…`, but the web's
`state.filter` started `{}` and never read `location.search`, so a deep link rendered the full corpus.
The spec for T-4.3 assumed the web honored these params; nothing in Phases 1–3 implemented it.
**Decision:** T-4.2 adds `applyUrlFilter()` (parses `project/session/tool/kind/error/corr/q` from
`location.search` into `state.filter`, reflects `q` into the search box) called first in `init()`.
Verified live (Playwright): `?tool=Edit` scopes to the 2 Edit rows with a removable chip. This is the
minimal change that makes the documented T-4.3 deep-link work end-to-end.

### D-4.c — multi-select → single-filter limitation (NOT extending the API) (T-4.3)
**Problem:** the picker multi-selects sessions/projects, but `/api/events` accepts a SINGLE `project`
and a SINGLE `session` (not repeated/OR-combined). PHASE4 T-4.3's note flags this and permits, as a
follow-up, extending the API to accept repeated `session=` — but only if recorded here first.
**Decision:** do NOT extend the API in Phase 4. The `--v2` branch maps a collapsed selection to one
scope: single project/session maps directly; a multi/mixed selection opens scoped by the first project
(else first session). The limitation is accepted and documented; no repeated-param OR support added.
If multi-session scoping becomes important, it's a separate task (extend `EventFilter`/server/query
+ web URL parsing) — explicitly deferred, not done here.

### D-4.d — `bun build tui/picker.tsx` smoke fails pre-existingly (Ink devtools); tsc is the gate (T-4.3)
**Problem:** the suggested `bun build tui/picker.tsx --target=bun` smoke exits 1 because Ink optionally
imports `react-devtools-core`, which Bun's bundler can't resolve. This reproduces with the `--v2` edit
stashed, so it is NOT caused by T-4.3.
**Decision:** the authoritative parse/typecheck for the TUI is `bun run --filter '@clogdy/tui' check`
(tsc with the JSX tsconfig), which is green. The bundler smoke is not a valid gate for this package.

## Phase 5 — React/TanStack web + virtualization + facet/SQL query

These are **settled, user-approved** calls (not ambiguities for the sub-orchestrator). Researched in
`scratchpad/phase5-query-ux.md` + `scratchpad/phase5-proposal.md`; encoded in `01-CONTRACTS.md` §6/§7/§8
and `07-PHASE5.md`. Phase 5 is **not** dry-run-validated.

### D-5.a — Query layer: facets + real SQL atop a facet-scoped CTE (NO DSL) (T-5.0)
**Problem:** the original Phase 5 proposal shipped a breser-style **query DSL** as the primary UX. The
user **rejected the DSL** ("I don't want a janky DSL… I expect the user to provide SQL in addition to
faceting… facet AND perform a SQL query atop the faceted data").
**Decision:** the query layer is **(facets) + (real read-only SQL over the facet-filtered relation)** —
the **Datasette model**. Facets build an `EventFilter` exactly as today; the user's SQL is wrapped in a
**facet-scoped CTE** so `FROM events` resolves to the faceted subset:
`WITH events AS (SELECT * FROM live.event <buildWhere(filter)>) SELECT * FROM (<user sql>) LIMIT cap+1`.
The DSL grammar/parser tasks (old T-5.1/T-5.5) are **dropped**. Facets stay first-class and always
available; SQL composes on top.

### D-5.b — Engine = DuckDB read-only via the analytics-CLI subprocess (NOT bun:sqlite in-server) (T-5.0)
**Decision:** `POST /api/query` proxies to the existing analytics CLI in a new `--query` mode (DuckDB,
READ_ONLY ATTACH via `withDuck`), spawned + kill-deadline-timed exactly like `/api/stats`. Rationale:
buys true analytical SQL (window fns, `quantile_cont`, CTEs) the user wants; **reuses** the proven
read-only-ATTACH + kill-deadline infra; respects ground rule #3 (no DuckDB in the server process); DuckDB
has **no in-process statement timeout**, so a kill-deadline subprocess is the only viable enforcement
anyway. `bun:sqlite` read-only in-process was considered and rejected: simpler but caps at SQLite's
weaker analytics and puts arbitrary-query hang/OOM risk in the live server process. Tradeoff accepted: a
subprocess per query (the same cost `/api/stats` pays; queries are user-initiated, never per-keystroke).

### D-5.c — Facets describe the INPUT set; SSE + keyset paging pause while SQL is active (T-5.0)
**Decision (the central tension, resolved honestly):** while custom SQL is active, facet **counts**
continue to come from `/api/facets` over the `EventFilter` — they describe the *scope* the query reads
"atop," and are **not** recomputed from the arbitrary SELECT (you cannot facet an arbitrary projection;
Datasette doesn't either, and Metabase's SQL→builder conversion is one-way). The facet sidebar stays
**live**: editing a facet re-runs the wrapped query with a new CTE body. **SSE is paused** and **keyset
paging (`afterId`) is replaced by a hard row cap** (a projection may omit `id`/aggregate rows away).
Clearing the SQL box returns to the live faceted `/api/events` + SSE path. The frozen `/api/events`,
`/api/facets`, `/api/events/stream` contracts are **untouched**; the SQL overlay is strictly additive.
Honest limit (facets = input scope, SQL = lens), surfaced in the UI banner.

### D-5.d — Framework = React 19 + TanStack; editor = CodeMirror 6 (T-5.0; budget removed — see D-5.k)
**Decision:** migrate `packages/web` from vanilla TS to **React 19 + `@tanstack/react-table` +
`@tanstack/react-virtual`**, bundled by the **existing `Bun.build`** (Bun transpiles JSX natively — no new
build tooling). React is already a repo dep (the Ink TUI runs React 19); virtualization (measured heights,
windowed DOM) fixes the 56k-row DOM blowup the demo exposed. **DuckDB-Wasm in the browser is rejected**
(multi-MB + must ship the corpus to the client; the server already runs DuckDB read-only). SQL editor =
**CodeMirror 6 + `@codemirror/lang-sql`** (Monaco rejected as multi-MB), shipped **unconditionally**.
~~a plain `<textarea>` is the documented zero-dep fallback if the web bundle exceeds ~80 kB gz~~ — the
**bundle budget / textarea fallback was removed by user directive**; see **D-5.k**. Bundle size is
informational only, not a constraint.

### D-5.e — Phase 5 is UI-centric: recorded Playwright artifacts (video + screenshots) are acceptance (T-5.0)
**Decision (user directive):** "this is a user interface. I expect evidence of correctness via artifacts
in the form of recorded Playwright tests (video and screenshot)." Every UI-touching task (T-5.2, T-5.3,
T-5.5, T-5.7) MUST produce **recorded** Playwright artifacts via `@playwright/test` (`video:'on'`,
`screenshot:'on'`) — the Playwright **MCP** does not record video and is not sufficient. Screenshots are
committed under `docs/v2/artifacts/phase5/` (small PNGs, durable evidence); videos go to the scratchpad
(too large to commit) and are **delivered to the user**. `test-results/` + `playwright-report/` are
gitignored. Self-report is never acceptance for a UI task. See `07-PHASE5.md` "Evidence protocol".

### D-5.f — `runQuery` reader API + BIGINT-as-string in the `--query` JSON (T-5.1, orchestrator-confirmed)
`runQuery` reads columns via `reader.columnNames()` and rows via `reader.getRowsJson()` (`@duckdb/node-api`).
`getRowsJson()` returns `Json[][]`, and DuckDB INTEGER/BIGINT columns serialize as **strings** (the `Json`
type has no bigint) — so a `COUNT(*)` cell comes back as `"9466"`, not `9466`. This is contract-compatible
(`rows: unknown[][]`); the generic web grid (T-5.5) renders values as text, so no coercion is needed there.
Analytics tests `Number()`-normalize before asserting. Documented so a future consumer expecting numeric
JSON isn't surprised.

### D-5.g — DuckDB CTE self-join over the SQLite-scanner CTE crashes; T-5.1 test (b) avoids the self-join (T-5.1)
DuckDB's `CTEInlining` optimizer crashes ("Attempted to access index 0 within vector of size 0") when the
facet `events` CTE — backed by the SQLite scanner via the READ_ONLY ATTACH — is **self-joined** inside the
user SQL (e.g. `FROM events u JOIN events r …`). This is an upstream DuckDB+sqlite-scanner bug, not our
code (a standalone repro confirms it). The spec's window-proof for T-5.1 test (b) was therefore changed
from a use→result self-join to `quantile_cont(ts, 0.5)` over a single `events` scan — still proves DuckDB
analytical SQL runs over the facet CTE. **MVP impact:** users issuing a self-join of `events` may hit this;
single-scan aggregates/windows (the canned examples) are unaffected. Revisit if a DuckDB upgrade fixes it.

### D-5.h — `v2:serve` takes DB/port via env vars (`CLOGDY_DB`/`CLOGDY_PORT`), not flags (Phase 5 e2e harness note)
`packages/server/src/serve.ts` resolves the DB via `resolvePaths({})` (honoring `CLOGDY_DB`, else the XDG
default) and the port via `CLOGDY_PORT` (default 7331) — it does **not** parse `--db`/`--port` argv. The
Playwright `webServer` (T-5.7) and any fixture-serve must set `CLOGDY_DB`/`CLOGDY_PORT` in the env, not
pass flags. Verified serving the 56k demo.db (`events:56015`, React `#root` + `/dist/main.js` 200).

### D-5.i — Playwright specs use the `.pw.ts` suffix so `bun test` ignores them (Phase 5 e2e harness, meta-orchestrator)
**Problem:** the lefthook pre-commit gate runs `bun test`, whose default matcher discovers
`*.spec.ts`/`*.test.ts` anywhere in the tree (excluding `node_modules`). A Playwright spec named
`*.spec.ts` is therefore picked up by Bun's runner, which crashes importing `@playwright/test`
("test() requires the playwright runner") → `bun test` goes red and blocks every commit. (This is why the
T-5.2 parity harness was left uncommitted by the killed orchestrator.)
**Decision:** all Playwright specs live under `packages/web/e2e/` and use the **`.pw.ts`** suffix (NOT
`.spec.ts`/`.test.ts`), which Bun's matcher ignores; `playwright.config.ts` sets `testMatch: "**/*.pw.ts"`
so Playwright still discovers them. The T-5.2 spec was renamed `t5.2-parity.spec.ts` → `t5.2-parity.pw.ts`.
**Every** Phase 5 e2e spec (T-5.3, T-5.5, T-5.7) MUST follow this `.pw.ts` convention. Verified: after the
rename `bun test` = 206 pass / 0 fail.

### D-5.j — T-5.6 buildWhere parameterization: positional $N via runAndReadAll(sql, params) (T-5.6)

**Problem:** `buildWhere` in `packages/analytics/src/duck.ts` previously built WHERE clauses by
single-quote-escaping string values and inlining them into the SQL text (`project = 'my-proj'`). The
spec required switching to DuckDB bound parameters so no filter value is ever string-concatenated into SQL.

**Decision / binding API used:** `@duckdb/node-api` `DuckDBConnection.runAndReadAll(sql, values)` accepts
an array of `DuckDBValue` as positional parameters; the SQL uses `$1`, `$2`, … placeholders. `buildWhere`
now returns `{ sql: string; params: (string | number | null)[] }` where `sql` contains `$N` placeholders
and `params` carries the values. All callers (metric functions + `buildQuery`/`runQuery`) thread the params
array through to `runAndReadAll(sql, params)`. The LIKE pattern for `q` is built as `%value%` in the param
(no `sq` escaping); `$N` may be referenced multiple times in one condition (DuckDB supports it). The `sq`
helper is retained (private) for the `ATTACH` statement path, which does not support parameters.

**Call-site threading:** every metric function (`toolCounts`, `errorRate`, `latency`, `projectRollup`,
`timeBuckets`) was updated to destructure `{ sql: where, params }` from `buildWhere` and pass `params` to
the internal `rows(conn, sql, params)` helper. `buildQuery` now returns `{ sql, params }` and `runQuery`
passes them to `conn.runAndReadAll(sql, params)`.

**Belt-and-suspenders (DuckDB multi-statement):** DuckDB does NOT automatically reject multi-statement SQL
in a single `run()` / `runAndReadAll()` call. The `@duckdb/node-api` README shows an `extractStatements`
API for iterating over multiple statements, and the C-level `duckdb_query` runs all statements in a batch.
Therefore `assertSelectOnly` in `@clogdy/shared` is the PRIMARY (and non-redundant) protection layer —
DuckDB itself provides no automatic multi-statement guard. Documented in a code comment in `sqlguard.ts`.

**Bug fixed as part of T-5.6:** `assertSelectOnly` previously used `stripped.includes(";")` to detect
multi-statement SQL. A `;` inside a single-quoted string literal (e.g. `SELECT ';' AS delim`) was
incorrectly flagged as a statement separator. Fixed by adding `hasSemicolonOutsideStrings(sql)` (a
string-literal-aware scanner that mirrors `stripSqlComments`'s state machine). The new function only
counts `;` found outside of string literals. `sqlguard.test.ts` now has test cases asserting `SELECT ';'`
passes and `SELECT ';'; DROP TABLE event` still fails.

### D-5.k — T-5.5 SQL editor = CodeMirror 6, shipped unconditionally (no bundle budget) (T-5.5, USER DIRECTIVE)

**Problem:** the original T-5.5 spec carried an `~80 KB gz` bundle-budget gate with a `<textarea>`
fallback (07-PHASE5.md T-5.5 + D-5.d). CodeMirror (`@uiw/react-codemirror ^4.23.0` +
`@codemirror/lang-sql ^6.8.0`) adds **~145 KB gz**, which exceeded that budget, and the first T-5.5
agent therefore shipped the textarea fallback.

**Decision (user, explicit):** *"We don't need a super compact bundle, especially when we're looking
for a better UX. CodeMirror is a superior UX to a text area. Well worth the bundle bloat."* The
**bundle budget is removed entirely** — there is **no budget gate and no textarea fallback**. Ship
**CodeMirror 6** unconditionally. The textarea version was reverted: `@uiw/react-codemirror` +
`@codemirror/lang-sql` re-added to `packages/web/package.json`; `SqlEditor.tsx` rewritten to use
`<CodeMirror>` (SQL highlighting via `@codemirror/lang-sql`, `theme="dark"`, Cmd/Ctrl-Enter via a
`Prec.highest(keymap.of([{key:"Mod-Enter"}]))` extension). The examples dropdown / Run button /
inline-error / SQL-mode toggle are unchanged; the client-side `^\s*(WITH|SELECT)\b/i` pre-check
stays. The `t5.5-sql.pw.ts` evidence spec was updated to drive CodeMirror's `.cm-content` (select-all
+ type) instead of a textarea `fill`.

**Bundle:** gz `dist/main.js` is **~294.6 KB** (T-5.2 baseline ~140 KB; +~155 KB for CodeMirror) —
accepted. Bundle size is **informational only** for this localhost single-user tool; it is not a
constraint and must not gate editor choice. (Supersedes the budget language in D-5.d / earlier
07-PHASE5.md, which have been updated to match.)

### D-5.m — Facets are multi-select: EventFilter dims accept `string | string[]` (OR within a dimension) (post-Phase-5, USER DIRECTIVE)

The five facet dimensions (`project`/`session`/`tool`/`kind`/`error`) now accept **multiple values**:
clicking a second value in the same section adds it (e.g. `kind = tool_use OR tool_result`) instead of
overriding. `EventFilter` widened those fields to `string | string[]` (a bare string is still valid →
**backward compatible**; existing single-value links/tests keep working). `asArray()` (shared)
normalizes single|array|absent → flat array, and the query builders emit `col = ?` for one value, `col
IN (?, …)` for many (server `buildConds`, analytics `buildWhere`). Transport: repeated query params
(`?kind=a&kind=b`), or an array in the `POST /api/query` body; the server's `parseFilter` reads all
values via `c.req.queries(k)`. The facet **exclude-own-dimension** rule is unchanged, so a dimension
with several values selected still lists every option (Datasette model). UI: one removable chip per
selected value; `FacetSidebar` marks a value active by set membership. Evidence: `queries.test.ts` /
`duck.test.ts` IN cases + `sql-columns-resize.pw.ts` "multi-select facets" e2e.

### Dev mode — `bun start --dev` rebuilds the web bundle on change (post-Phase-5, USER DIRECTIVE)

`packages/web/build.ts --watch` does an initial (un-minified, faster) build then `fs.watch`es
`packages/web/src` and rebuilds (debounced) on every change; `index.html` is served statically so a CSS
edit there only needs a refresh. `bun start --dev` (alias `bun run v2:dev`) spawns that watcher as a
child alongside the ingester + server (all torn down together on Ctrl-C). Edit a component, the bundle
rebuilds in ~100 ms, refresh the browser to see it.

### D-5.n — `role` (message envelope) stored as a first-class facet dimension (post-Phase-5, USER DIRECTIVE)

**Problem:** the UI exposed `kind` (content-block type: prompt/text/thinking/tool_use/tool_result) but
not `message.role` (user/assistant). `kind` was assumed to subsume role, but `flattenLine` derives
`kind` from the content block and **discards `message.role` entirely** — so role is NOT recoverable from
kind. Ground-truth over the live transcripts: `kind=text` splits **11,655 assistant / 219 user** (the
219 are slash-command bodies, `[Request interrupted by user]`, "Continue…", and plain prompts that
arrive as a `text` block instead of a string); `prompt`→user, `thinking`/`tool_use`→assistant,
`tool_result`→user are 1:1, but `text` is genuinely ambiguous. Storing `role` adds information the
auditing UI needs (distinguish user-authored from assistant-authored text).

**Decision:** add `role: string | null` as a first-class column/type/facet, **orthogonal to `kind`**
(kind = which block, role = who authored the envelope). `flattenLine` captures `line.message.role` onto
every event from that line; `event.role TEXT` + `event_role` index; `queryFacets`/`buildWhere`/
`FacetSidebar` gain a `role` dimension exactly like `kind`. Top-level transcript `type` was considered
and rejected as a separate dimension: its non-user/assistant values (`summary`, `system`, `attachment`,
`mode`, `pr-link`, …) are metadata sidecar lines with **no `message`**, which `flattenLine` already
drops — so `type` carries nothing beyond `role` for the events we keep.

**Migration (additive, per §2):** `SCHEMA_VERSION → 2`. `openDb` runs `ALTER TABLE event ADD COLUMN role
TEXT` when an existing `event` table lacks it (before applying SCHEMA_SQL, so the new `event_role` index
builds against the present column) — an existing DB keeps working with zero manual steps, `role` simply
NULL on pre-existing rows. **Backfilling history requires `--reset`**: idempotent `INSERT OR IGNORE`
(UNIQUE(uuid,block_idx)) never updates existing rows, so re-ingest alone can't populate a new derived
column. The `role` facet's `role IS NOT NULL` guard hides the un-backfilled NULLs until a reset. Ground
rule #6 (DB is a rebuildable cache) sanctions the reset.

## Logging — structured logs as proof-of-correctness evidence

### D-L.a — pino in sync-fd mode; one JSONL evidence schema; stderr/file-never-stdout

**Decision:** add structured logging so a reviewer or a test can confirm the system behaved correctly
(facet counts, SSE delivered N, analytics attached READ_ONLY, kill-deadline fired, SQL guard rejected
non-SELECT) from logs alongside Playwright video/screenshots. **Engine = pino in *sync-fd mode*** —
`pino(pino.destination({ fd: 2, sync: true }))` on node, `pino/browser` on web — with **no worker-thread
transports** (a transport spawns a worker per process — wasteful for the per-request analytics child and a
known Bun friction point). pino is kept only for the genuinely hard parts it already solves: never-throws,
safe serialization of circular refs / `Error` / `BigInt`, and `redact` over *private* transcript data; the
~80-line core is all it replaces. `pino-pretty` stays a **dev-only out-of-process CLI pipe**, never an
in-process transport.

**Sinks / wires (the invariant):** structured logs go to **stderr or a file, never stdout**. The
**analytics** process logs to a **file only** (never stdout *or* stderr): its stdout is the JSON-result
wire the server `JSON.parse`s and its stderr is the error-string wire the server forwards to the user —
both reserved. Without `CLOGDY_LOG_DIR` analytics is **silent** and the server narrates it; pino's default
`dest` (fd 1) is overridden to fd 2/file everywhere so a stray byte can never corrupt the data wire.

**One JSONL schema** both node + browser emit via the shared `SCHEMA_OPTS`: `ts` (ISO), string `level`,
`proc`, `pid`, `evt` (the assertable key) — `base:{proc,pid}` replaces pino's default `{pid,hostname}` so
**no hostname** leaks into committed artifacts. Levels are **`debug` … `error` plus `silent`** — **no
`trace`** (explicitly out of scope). Two env vars, inherited by every spawned child: `CLOGDY_LOG_LEVEL`
(default `info`) and `CLOGDY_LOG_DIR` (per-process `<proc>[-<pid>].jsonl`). The node sink is reached only
via the `@clogdy/shared/node` subpath (never the barrel) so pino's `node:fs`/`sonic-boom` stay out of the
web bundle (verified: `dist/main.js` has zero `sonic-boom`/`thread-stream`/`node:fs`).

**Spike result:** the pino-on-Bun spike **passed** on Bun 1.3.14 — sync-fd output is byte-clean, the
analytics-silent path leaks nothing to stdout even at `debug`, circular/`Error` never throw (`"[Circular]"`
/ serialized `message`+`stack`), and the `@clogdy/shared/node` subpath resolves under the `file:` workspace
dep. The hand-rolled-core fallback in the plan was therefore not needed.
